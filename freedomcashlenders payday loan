Cash flow refers to the money “flowing” in and out of your business. Net cash flow is the money you have left over after you subtract the money your business has spent (rent, inventory purchases, debt payments, etc.) from the money it has earned (operational income, investment income, funding, etc.).
Cash flow formula

Ideally, your business will have positive cash flow, meaning you have more coming in than going out. When applying for financing, you may manually create a cash flow statement, or use accounting software; however, a lender will likely do its own cash flow analysis as well.
Collateral

Collateral is typically a valuable asset that’s used to secure your business loan. If you’re unable to repay your loan, a lender can recover some of the money it loaned by liquidating the assets you’ve pledged. Collateral is considered a risk mitigant and can improve your chances of getting approved or lead to more favorable rates and terms. Things like real estate, cash deposits or equipment can be used to secure a loan.
