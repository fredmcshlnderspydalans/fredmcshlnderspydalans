Whether you’re an entrepreneur looking for startup capital or an experienced small-business owner and operator, there are a few small-business financing terms you’re bound to hear on a regular basis. Even if you’re not actively applying for a small-business loan, it’s beneficial to be proactive in understanding some of these terms.  
Annual percentage rate

The annual percentage rate (APR) helps you understand the true cost of a loan. It reflects a lender’s interest rate plus all fees and extra costs associated with a loan, annualized and rolled into a percentage rate. When deciding between different loan offers, small-business owners can use APR to compare how much each loan will really cost.
Asset

Assets in business are items — tangible or intangible — that hold value for a company. Tangible assets are things like cash reserves, real estate property, inventory or equipment. Intangible assets may include trademarks, employee expertise or even a strong customer base. Tangible assets can typically be used as collateral to secure a business loan.
