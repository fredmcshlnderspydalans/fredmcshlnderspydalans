Debt financing is any method of financing that involves taking on debt, or lump sums of money that your business has to repay. Term loans, SBA loans and lines of credit are all included in this type of financing.

The cost of debt financing can vary depending on what type of loan you get and who the lender is. Bank term loans, for example, are among the most affordable types of debt but usually require good personal credit and at least two years in business. Lines of credit or even term loans from online lenders can have much higher interest rates but may approve borrowers with poor personal credit or startup businesses.
